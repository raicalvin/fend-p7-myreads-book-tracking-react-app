# Web App: MyReads Book Tracking React App

## Project Information

### About

This web application uses React to compose a single-page application that keeps tracks of a users book list. The user can sort their books onto different shelves, search for new books to add to their shelves, and manage books between shelves. This project was for my Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree.
